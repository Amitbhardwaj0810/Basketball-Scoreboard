# Basketball Scoreboard Monitoring System

## Description
- This project involves designing and implementing a scoreboard monitoring system for basketball games. The system uses digital counters and display units to track scores, accept input and display information in real-time, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience during the game.

## Project Overview
- Scoreboard Design: The project focuses on designing a digital circuit to monitor basketball game scores.
- Components Used: IC 7474, IC 7490 and Common Anode 7 Segment Displays
- System Output: Users can observe real-time score updates on the 7 segment displays, confirming the functionality and integration of the components.
  
## Technical Details
- IC 7474:
  - Function: Edge-triggered device changing Q output on input trigger pulse edge.
  - Purpose: Ensures precise and reliable counting with synchronous inputs.
- IC 7490:
  - Function: MOD-10 Decade Counter counting binary numbers from 0000 to 1001.
  - Purpose: Tracks scores in binary form, converting to decimal for display.
- 7 Segment Display:
  - Type: Common Anode (CA).
  - Operation: Low current operation, commonly used for digital displays.
  - Purpose: Displays scores in a readable format.
